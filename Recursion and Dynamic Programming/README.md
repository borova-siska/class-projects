# Recursion and Dynamic Programming

A simple problem given for 20% of the Advanced Algorithms course at UQ was to design an algorithm to fit as many cars on to some number of available ferries for the least cost. Part 1 was to design a recursive solution and part 2 was to improve the solution from exponential to polynomial using dynamic programming. Included is my solution.
